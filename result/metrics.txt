Same Data – Different Models
Housing Price Prediction Results
================================

Dataset:
California Housing Dataset
Target: median_house_value

Train/Test Split:
75% Train / 25% Test
Random State: 42


Model 1: Linear Regression
--------------------------
Train R² : 63.367
Test R²  : 64.614
RMSE     : 69189.94
MAE      : 50959.77

Observation:
The model is simple and stable but underfits the data.
Both train and test scores are low, indicating high bias.


Model 2: Decision Tree
----------------------
Train R² : 100.000
Test R²  : 64.907
RMSE     : 68903.25
MAE      : 43221.75

Observation:
The model perfectly fits training data but fails to generalize.
This shows clear overfitting and high variance.


Model 3: Random Forest
---------------------
Train R² : 97.462
Test R²  : 82.168
RMSE     : 49117.16
MAE      : 31992.80

Observation:
Random Forest balances bias and variance well.
It generalizes better and performs best on unseen data.


Note:
- Linear Regression: low train & test → high bias
- Decision Tree: perfect train, low test → high variance
- Random Forest: high train, high test → good balance
